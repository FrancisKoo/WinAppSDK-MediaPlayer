# WinAppSDK-MediaPlayer
Prototype of a MediaPlayerElement for the Windows App SDK

WinUI 3 does not currently have a [MediaPlayerElement](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.MediaPlayerElement) like UWP XAML does.
This project shows how one can use the MediaPlayer API to play video into a WinUI 3 SwapChainPanel element, backed by a DirectX swapchain.
